Hi Everyone!

Today we're going to create a To-do list App with JavaScript (Vanilla JavaScript: No Framework).

In this tutorial, a JavaScript Beginner can create a functional to-do list with ease and won't face any problems doing that.

You must know the basics in JavaScript and HTML. 

Let's talk about the application you're going to build. 

When you add a to-do task, the app updates it by adding it to the to-do list. 

And when you finish a task and you want to delete that task you can simply press the bin icon to remove that to-do task from the list.
